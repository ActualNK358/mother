;jp uses the raw pointers for messages, and has no pointer list

;depending on version...
;JP:
;UMSG_list is generated from all instances of MSG_ labels in dialogue files.
;more files may need to be specified, but for now this should be fine.
;US:
;UMSG_list is generated from the pointer list, since that's what gets accessed.
;pretty straightforward tbh

;the version is then .ifdef'd during build to get a generated output that works with the version you chose
;tldr, if you build US you will be using the pointer list, and if you build JP you don't!
;either way, you still access them the same! isnt that fun

;this system might be incredibly fucked but it gets the job done. feel free to make betterâ„¢
;UMSG stands for Use Message by the way. or at least it did. could be Universal now. idk
