# Mother
WIP disassembly of Mother/Earthbound Zero/Earthbound Beginnings for the NES

Supports the English localization of Mother (Zero or Beginnings should work), with plans on making compatability with the original release.

For WSL2 Ubuntu. Probably also works on actual Linux.

Run `./install` to download and set up cc65

Run `./configure` to generate disassembly and split banks
Supports Mother (J) and Earthbound Beginnings (U)

Run `./build` to make a new rom from src files
Run `./build -j` to make a new japanese rom

Still incredibly wip, i do not have enough knowledge to know why parts do and dont work

I've started work on getting text building, though apart from that I have next to no idea of what I'm doing.
